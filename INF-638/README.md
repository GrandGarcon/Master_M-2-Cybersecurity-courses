1. brush up the entierity of TCP/IP stack with this open source book  , but with extensive jargon :- http://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/current/ComputerNetworks.pdf


2. TCP / IP current tools of stack :- getting the practical tools implementation with the courses of cisco but with open source alternatives . 
  
  I . -[X][Deep packet inspection filter](). start with the some open source implementation like nTOP (https://github.com/ntop/nDPI.git) which provides to modularly add all the possible 7 layer implementation.
  
  
  
  
  
  II. -[X][tutorials on securing the Linux server]
      [from a short introduction from the linux server security ](http://etutorials.org/Linux+systems/secure+linux-based+servers/Chapter+2.+Designing+Perimeter+Networks/).
      [Evolving into  more instructive github contributed course]()



3.  operating systems for the embedded devices ( for configuring  the routers , switches , dynamic table , take help from the iptable and other tutorials from the INF 571). 
  -[ ] [apache server deploying and filter  architecture](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/filter.html) :- getting the depth of the  looging and filtering information of clients 
        -[ ][parsing log apache tutorial](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server#why-secure-your-server) 
      

4. Pfsense :- the Tool for  building the  filtering on MAC and networking layer with more finer granularity.
