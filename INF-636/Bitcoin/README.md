#  Bitcoin : from basics to real time use cases 
 This directory will consist of the  the tutiorials that i did in my INF 636 class explaning the fundamentals of Bitcoin blockchain , 
 Bitcoin scripting   , lightning network and finally nakamoto concensus layer. 
 
 i will be making available notes here , not the actual excercises  given the copywrite concerns . also some contemplations about the recent researches in this 
 field and how we can avoid the repeat of the centralization  of the coin and also the complete financial aspects .
