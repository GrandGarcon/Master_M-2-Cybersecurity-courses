for diffrent  real time use cases. also there will be courses on nakamoto concensus and other proof of consensus  from Mme brost. 

To-Do :- 
1. have a up to date documentation of the codebase api and the way of  getting the attacks using the obfuscation while defeating the security checks of the  elf and Pe formats : document is attached alsong with this email :- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03487.pdf.

  2. running the bitcoin node into the docker container and then getting the memory dump using the meterpreter . thus making the malware to try to get the server to parse and taking the screenshot .
