# playbook-chef : 
## Creating an fullstack red team playbooks  for allowing  non programmers to define the workflows  the red teaming  using n8n .

## abstract 

Given the major deficit in the cybersecurity skill shortage is due to the fact that of having more  abundance of the security professionals being more alligned to the less technical role in the space ( being the generalist , consultants  etc)
thus in order to bridge the gap , recently there has been many tools like [atomic red teaming](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team).
thus my idea is to  implement these "workflow" automation tools to design the whole stack , along with  allowing the analyst to understand the current netowkr state , and define events ( alerts , integration with other tools etc) in case of any critical logs ( based on the threat intelligence standards ).
