# Security Orchestration , Automation and Response 
references : [Awesome-SOAR by correlated security](https://github.com/correlatedsecurity/Awesome-SOAR)

in short , terms to the organisational framework of automating the cybersecurity threat analysis and mitigation lifecycle as well as response in case of the event of the attack . this was more want to implementation , gven the complexicity of the large malware  ,  intracable c2c  infrastructure  well funded states . also the tools allow for the organisation to define the 
test analysis  and then responding to the threats real time 

Starting with the global standards , some of the famous ones are  the follows :


## 1. NIST cybersecurity : 

its being an standards by the industry to insure both technical and  physical changes to be implemented in order to have a better posture in handling the associated risk in the cybersecurity 
risk posturing .  it has mainly 3 main components :

  - framework core :categorisation of standards , guidelines an references of the best pratices that are to be  taken in roder to maintain the implementation of the 
    - Identify , protect , detect , respond and recover ( basic)
      - defining functions categories and infomrative references 
  
  
  
  - Framework implementation tiers : providing the contexts how organisations consider the risk and implementing the need to implement that risk. 
    -  from partial implementation to adaptive ( highest level).  
    - partial conssit of management of the risk management process policies (ISO 27001 ) , prioritisation of the cyber
    - External Participation : taking also into the understanding of larger ecosystem of diffrent suppliers  
    - integrated risk mgmt program : organisation wide approach for managing the cybersecurity risk . 
  
  
  - Framework Profile : represntation of the outcomes are being mapped into the profiles of the certain entity into the categories of risk .  
  
  ## Coordination of framework implementation :
    - Implementation of common flow of information and decisions between Executive , diffrent business/ process between the same organisation and the 
    diffrent .
    
    - Implementation of steps to improve the Cybersecurity profile :
      - Prioritise & Scope --> Orient the assets and systems present / identified in the prev step to adapt to the  tier the requirements --> creating the current profile for the diffrent tests / compliance methods (just like implementation of the )
      - Determine , analyze and prioritize gaps in the test tuns ( for instance MITRE ATTA&K 
    
    
    
  ## Cyber Supply chain risk management  standards by NIST (to be  read from the DoD supply chain risk analysis standards and manutrity standards - WIP ):

  All of the previous presented projects represents  only the management and systems persepectives for actionable management and prevention techniques for incident response crisis . now for coming to more 
  active analysis of the based on the first stage of the  Actionable SOAR : Having an Framework for storing the   diffrent Incident response techniques . 
  they contain the segmented information ( still not in depth technical ) which explains the general mitigation techniques / standards to be needed to implement for security.
