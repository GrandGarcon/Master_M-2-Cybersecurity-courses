# creation of usecase of iot ecosystem with blockchain : IOTA and its WASP smart contracts.


## Abstract :

IOTA has been prominent blockchain ecosystem which tends to be compatible to the resource constraints and security requirements for the LPWAN and commercial iot protocols .  but in order to scale the ecosystem , there has been urgent need to scale the ecosystem ( as even directed  graph table and consensus  tends to have serious security deficiencies in order to scale ) . thus  the most  geunine method is the implementation of the off chain smart contract and publishing the smart contracts . the [following tutorial](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/blob/master/articles/intro/dwf.md)  will be help to understand the web ecosystem .

Along with the  above fact , as we read from the notes ,  the most versatile iot ecosystem , web of things can be connected with  theis ISCP contracts , which i will be explaining the latter sections .
