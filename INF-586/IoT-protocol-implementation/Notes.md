# Notes  about the ecosystem of the IoT protocol stacks  and their development on Rust

## Context 

Although the  connected objects market has been significantly increased by leaps , but being facing the same issues like that of the evolution of ARPA  into present internet (i.e centralisation of tech stack , incompatiblity with the current  netorking architecture to be modular ,   hourglass approach of TCP/IP to support transitioning to ipv6 , security concerns ,  etc ). managing the wide variety of optimisation factors (data BW , security , processing power etc) , needs a cross  collaboration between the diffrent  standards using the developmental programming language that  integrates the  low latency development , type safety and also creating  apps on VM ebing secure and platform language independt( WASM) . thus Rust holds all the promises for being the one .


Thus my Aim is to follow the  prominent standards in the IoT standards across all the scales (Low power , 5G based , critical systems in healthcare , sensing or IIOT systems or more trendier "Industry 4.0" ). and to  explain and  implement their basic examples in Rust based stack and trying to solve certain bottleneck issues in real use cases taken from  github or market players
